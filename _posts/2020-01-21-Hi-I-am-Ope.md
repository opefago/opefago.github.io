Hello, This is obviously my first post, the thought of having my personal blog has bounced on and off a few times, but I'd been too lazy to set up one, or maybe I get easily carried away by happenings around me.
 
One of my commitment this year is to take knowldge sharing seriously and as such open myself to learning new things.
 
I will be using this platform to share insights, ideas, discoveries and my thoughts, as I am using static templating tool for generating the blog template, there is no room for leaving comments, always feel free to reachout to me on any of my social media handles ( preferably on [twitter][twitter] ) in case of errors, typos or if you've got a few points to add to what I say here, honestly, I don't bite and i am particular opened to criticism.
 
I am very much happy to start out this journey and hope it will be one that will last a lifetime, looking forward to sharing and learning.
