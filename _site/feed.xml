        <title>Hi, I am Ope</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, This is obviously my first post, the thought of having my personal blog has bounce on and off a few times, but I’d been too lazy to set up one, or maybe I get easily carried away by happenings around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my commitment this year is to take knowldge sharing seriously and as such open myself to learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be using this platform to share insights, ideas, discoveries and my thoughts, as I am using static templating tool for generating the blog template, there is no room for leaving comments, always feel free to reachout to me on any of my social media handles ( preferably on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ope_fago&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; ) in case of errors, typos or if you’ve got a few points to add to what I say here, honestly, I don’t bite and i am particular opened to criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very much happy to start out this journey and hope it will be one that will last a lifetime, looking forward to sharing and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
