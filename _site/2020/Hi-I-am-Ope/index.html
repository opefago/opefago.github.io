  <title>Hi, I am Ope</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Hello, This is obviously my first post, the thought of having my personal blog has bounced on and off a few times, but I’d been too lazy to set up one, or maybe I get easily carried away by happenings around me.

One of my commitment this year is to take knowldge sharing seriously and as such open myself to learning new things.

I will be using this platform to share insights, ideas, discoveries and my thoughts, as I am using static templating tool for generating the blog template, there is no room for leaving comments, always feel free to reachout to me on any of my social media handles ( preferably on twitter ) in case of errors, typos or if you’ve got a few points to add to what I say here, honestly, I don’t bite and i am particular opened to criticism.

I am very much happy to start out this journey and hope it will be one that will last a lifetime, looking forward to sharing and learning.

<p><strong><em>:::Update:::</em></strong> After some tweaking, i finally figured how to add comments and creating extensions using <a href="https://disqus.com/">disqus</a> plugin, I didn’t mention that this blog is set up using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, which is an awesome blogging framework for those who love to tinker</p>
